# StreamPay Wallet App

StreamPay Wallet is the contactless, frictionless mobile payment and wallet for the Solana ecosystem.

To try it out do the following:

1. Download Expo Go here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/ Coming soon!
2. Go to this link and scan the QR code (this will open the app in Expo Go): https://expo.dev/ Coming Soon!
3. Connect your wallet, explore the app and make a trade and trade USDC, SOL for STRM for a guaranteed successful trade (switching out data providers right now so other tokens are broken).

Stream is a non-custodial wallet and therefore does not store data about you or your wallet. Your wallet secret phrase is encrypted on the device and can only be accessed using the passcode you set up locally.

Please let us know what you think and be sure to give us a follow on Twitter for Stream Wallet updates: https://twitter.com/stream_protocol
